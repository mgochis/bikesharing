## Overview

CitiBike is attempting to expand their operation by adding Des Moines as a new market for their bike share program. We used data collected from CitiBike in their NYC market to put together a presentation in Tableau. Using Tableau will help paint a picture of the ride sharing program in NYC by analyzing several metrics such as trip durations, bike utilization, trips by gender, etc. The story told in Tableau will help to decide if expanding to Des Moines is a good move.  

## Results
### Average Trip Duration

This graph shows the average trip duration. Most bike rentals last for 5 minutes then drastically drop the longer the ride. Nearly all of bike rentals are complete by the first hour. 

### Average Trip Duration by Gender

The average trip duration by gender doesn’t change much from the entire data set. 5-minute trips are still the most frequent amongst males and 6 minutes for females. Most of the trips are by males. 

### Trip Heatmap by Weekday

Using the heatmap we can see that rides during the week peak in the afternoon between 5pm and 6pm. There is also heavy traffic in the mornings during the week right around 8am. On Saturday and Sunday. The number of trips are steady throughout each day. Wednesday afternoons see a drop off activity which doesn’t correlate with the other days of the week. Thursday between 5pm and 6pm appear to be the busiest time during the week. 

### Trip Heatmap by Weekday and Gender

Trips between Male and Female are consistent on time and weekdays. There is more volume with males since that is the majority demographic checking out bikes. Riders that do not report gender appear to have an increase in volume on the weekends.

### Top Starting Locations

The starting location map shows where trips are started at the time of rental. Most of these start in the middle of the city. 

### Top Ending Locations

The ending location map shows where trips are completed. Most of the trips end in the middle of the city just like the starting map. There is a larger amount of ending locations outside of the city. 

### Bike Repairs

Bike utilization appears to be balanced between all bikes. Some bikes do have a higher utilization rate, which would explain a higher repair rates on those bikes. Further analysis may show that the most utilized bikes are inside of the city while the under-utilized might be outside of the city. 

## Summary

The story told by the Tableau dashboard gives a summary of the CitiBike operation in NYC. In general, mostly males use the service, typically before and after the workday. Most of the trips are inside the most populated areas of the city. A visualization that shows bike utilization based on location could be helpful to discover how to position the bikes around the city. In addition, another visualization that shows trip duration based on a percentage of all trips instead of a count would help show a clearer usage summary. A visualization that shows the distance of each trip would help understand usages.
